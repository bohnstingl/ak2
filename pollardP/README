Pollard P

This task was implemented using the sage notebook.
The PollardP.sws can be imported in the sage notebook.
The function PollardP can be used to apply the attack on the given Parameters

pollardP(y, g, p)
whereas the parametes statisfy the equation g^alpha = y mod p.
alpha is the unknown parameter.

example:
pollardP(22, 2, 37)

the result is the parameter alpha

The results of this task are listed in the file as alpha, beta, alpha2 and beta2
